## What is OWASP ZAP?

The [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)][zap owasp project] is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the ZAP Docker Scan Scripts. By default, the secureCodeBox ZAP Helm Chart installs all four ZAP scripts: `zap-baseline`, `zap-full-scan` , `zap-api-scan` & `zap-automation-scan`. Listed below are the arguments supported by the `zap-baseline` script, which are mostly interchangeable with the other ZAP scripts (except for `zap-automation-scan`). For a more complete reference check out the [ZAP Documentation](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/) and the secureCodeBox based ZAP examples listed below.

The command line interface can be used to easily run server scans: `-t www.example.com`

```bash
Usage: zap-baseline.py -t <target> [options]
    -t target         target URL including the protocol, eg https://www.example.com
Options:
    -h                print this help message
    -c config_file    config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -u config_url     URL of config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -g gen_file       generate default config file (all rules set to WARN)
    -m mins           the number of minutes to spider for (default 1)
    -r report_html    file to write the full ZAP HTML report
    -w report_md      file to write the full ZAP Wiki (Markdown) report
    -x report_xml     file to write the full ZAP XML report
    -J report_json    file to write the full ZAP JSON document
    -a                include the alpha passive scan rules as well
    -d                show debug messages
    -P                specify listen port
    -D                delay in seconds to wait for passive scanning
    -i                default rules not in the config file to INFO
    -I                do not return failure on warning
    -j                use the Ajax spider in addition to the traditional one
    -l level          minimum level to show: PASS, IGNORE, INFO, WARN or FAIL, use with -s to hide example URLs
    -n context_file   context file which will be loaded prior to spidering the target
    -p progress_file  progress file which specifies issues that are being addressed
    -s                short output format - dont show PASSes or example URLs
    -T                max time in minutes to wait for ZAP to start and the passive scan to run
    -z zap_options    ZAP command line options e.g. -z "-config aaa=bbb -config ccc=ddd"
    --hook            path to python file that define your custom hooks
```

## ZAP Automation Scanner Configuration

The Automation Framework allows for higher flexibility in configuring ZAP scans. Its goal is the automation of the full functionality of ZAP's GUI. The configuration of the Automation Framework differs from the other three ZAP scan types. The following security scan configuration example highlights the differences for running a `zap-automation-scan`.
Of particular interest for us will be the -autorun option. `zap-automation-scan` allows for providing an automation file as a ConfigMap that defines the details of the scan. See the secureCodeBox based ZAP Automation example listed below for what such a ConfigMap would look like.

```bash
Usage: zap.sh -cmd -host <target> [options]
    -t target         target URL including the protocol, eg https://www.example.com
Add-on options:
    -script <script>          Run the specified script from commandline or load in GUI
    -addoninstall <addOnId>   Installs the add-on with specified ID from the ZAP Marketplace
    -addoninstallall          Install all available add-ons from the ZAP Marketplace
    -addonuninstall <addOnId> Uninstalls the Add-on with specified ID
    -addonupdate              Update all changed add-ons from the ZAP Marketplace
    -addonlist                List all of the installed add-ons
    -certload <path>          Loads the Root CA certificate from the specified file name
    -certpubdump <path>       Dumps the Root CA public certificate into the specified file name, this is suitable for importing into browsers
    -certfulldump <path>      Dumps the Root CA full certificate (including the private key) into the specified file name, this is suitable for importing into ZAP
    -notel                    Turns off telemetry calls
    -hud                      Launches a browser configured to proxy through ZAP with the HUD enabled, for use in daemon mode
    -hudurl <url>             Launches a browser as per the -hud option with the specified URL
    -hudbrowser <browser>     Launches a browser as per the -hud option with the specified browser, supported options: Chrome, Firefox by default 'Firefox'
    -openapifile <path>       Imports an OpenAPI definition from the specified file name
    -openapiurl <url>         Imports an OpenAPI definition from the specified URL
    -openapitargeturl <url>   The Target URL, to override the server URL present in the OpenAPI definition. Refer to the help for supported format.
    -quickurl <target url>    The URL to attack, e.g. http://www.example.com
    -quickout <filename>      The file to write the HTML/JSON/MD/XML results to (based on the file extension)
    -autorun <filename>       Run the automation jobs specified in the file.
    -autogenmin <filename>    Generate template automation file with the key parameters.
    -autogenmax <filename>    Generate template automation file with all parameters.
    -autogenconf <filename>   Generate template automation file using the current configuration.
    -graphqlfile <path>       Imports a GraphQL Schema from a File
    -graphqlurl <url>         Imports a GraphQL Schema from a URL
    -graphqlendurl <url>      Sets the Endpoint URL
```

{{- define "extra.chartConfigurationSection" -}}
The secureCodeBox provides two different scanner charts (`zap`, `zap-advanced`) to automate ZAP WebApplication security scans. The first one `zap` comes with four scanTypes:
- `zap-baseline-scan`
- `zap-full-scan`
- `zap-api-scan`
- `zap-automation-scan`

The scanTypes `zap-baseline-scan`, `zap-full-scan` & `zap-api-scan` can be configured via CLI arguments which are somehow a bit limited for some advanced usecases, e.g. using custom zap scripts or configuring complex authentication settings.

That's why we introduced this `zap-advanced` scanner chart, which introduces extensive YAML configuration options for ZAP. The YAML configuration can be split in multiple files and will be merged at start.
ZAP's own Automation Framework provides similar functionality to the `zap-advanced` scanner chart and is set to displace it in the future.
